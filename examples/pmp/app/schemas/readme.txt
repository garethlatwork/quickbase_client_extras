
The XML files in this folder contain the XML returned by call to the QuickBase 
API_GetSchema HTTP API.  The XML is processed by the QuickBase::Client class 
in the file QuickBaseClient.rb in order to get the list of columns in each 
table and to get the properties of the columns.

The files are here to help you understand what happens behind the scenes.
